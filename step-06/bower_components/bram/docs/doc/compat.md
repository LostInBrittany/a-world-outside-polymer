## Browser Compatibility

Bram targets IE11 and modern browsers. Bram uses several features not available in all browsers, so polyfills need to be provided.

### Proxy

Bram uses [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to make data-binding more elegant. Simply make changes to `this.model` inside of your element and the template will be automatically updated.

Since not all browsers can do this, you need to include the [Proxy polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/proxy-polyfill). A caveat to the polyfill usage is that all properties should be *predefined* in the constructor. That means instead of doing this:

```js
class MyElement extends Bram.Element {
  setTime() {
    this.model.time = new Date();
  }
}
```

Instead give the property an initial value in your constructor like so:

```js
class MyElement extends Bram.Element {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.model.time = null;
  }

  setTime() {
    this.model.time = new Date();
  }
}
```

### Map

Bram uses [Maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) to keep track of event bindings. We use maps very simply, so a small polyfill like in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/matthewp/81199932db5e1e487a2ea6a15983ac73) is sufficient, but you could also use a more robust polyfill like [es6-shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim).

### Mutation Observer

If using `childrenConnectedCallback` the [MutationObserver](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/tree/master/src/MutationObserver) polyfill is needed.

### Custom Elements

Bram isn't very useful without custom elements ðŸ¤ ! We recommend [webcomponents/custom-elements](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements) for that.

### Shadow DOM

Bram can be used without Shadow DOM if using the [renderMode](api.html#rendermode) option. However Shadow DOM is great and you probably want to use it for at least some elements. In that case [cloudydom](https://github.com/skatejs/cloudydom) is the way to go.
